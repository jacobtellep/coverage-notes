### Algolia
- [Initial Project Setup](https://app.asana.com/0/1201454665996628/1206808537595007/f)
  - Finished creating a demo index. it is called [demo_crds_net_new](https://dashboard.algolia.com/apps/8Y3N3H5PNJ/explorer/browse?searchMode=search).
  - I integrated two webhooks using the Algolia template in Contentful
    - [Deletion Webhook](https://app.contentful.com/spaces/y3a9myzsdjan/settings/webhooks/1R0OXkd7wJGY9L5n906LnY/activity-log)
    - [Creation Webhook](https://app.contentful.com/spaces/y3a9myzsdjan/settings/webhooks/1R12xe5s6IAF7Uf2pxi3Ng/activity-log)
  - You can configure the [payload](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-management-api/#/reference/webhooks) from Contentful. I had planned on doing that, but ran out of time due to the other Four Seven tasks. It could be debated whether that should be done in another card, though. I don't know if we know what metadata is important to us at this time.
- [Build Serverless Functions For Nested Content](https://app.asana.com/0/1201454665996628/1206808537595011/f)
